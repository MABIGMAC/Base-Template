# Git Process (Things Users need to memorise)

## Creating a new Epic issue

1. Via Project Board
   * Click "Add Item" under desired column

   * Fill in details and Assign labels
2. Via Issues Board
   * Creating a new issue, use Epic template
   * List the features(tasks) in the Epic

   * Click inside the new issue,
     * Edit and add /template for the feature template
     * Add the labels
     * Add the sprint
2. Via Issues Board

   1. Convert to Issue
      * Inside Epic issue, in the task list, click on the task
      * Click inside the new issue,
        * Edit and add /template for the feature template
        * Add the labels
        * Add the sprint
        * Link to project and assign to Todo Column
   2. Create new Issue
      * Add new feature template
      * Adjust the labels
      * Add the sprint
      * Goto the Epic issue and edit, adding the index of the new feature issue into the task list

## Creating a new bug issue

1. Via Project Board
   * Click "Add Item" under desired column
   * Enter name to create Draft
   * Click into it and "Convert to issue", selecting repo
   * Edit Description, enter /templates > Bug
   * Fill in details and Assign labels

   3. Adjust the labels
   4. Add the sprint

## Creating Research Tickets

1. Via Project Board

   * Click "Add Item" under desired column
   * Enter name to create Draft

## Branching off and coding

1. All dev work should be branched from the dev branch and PR'd into it when completed
2. New Branches must have the prefix of **git conventions**, followed by **/** (e.g. feat/Title)
3. Git commits must follow git convention format (Enforced by STARLAB Augments: Pre-commit hooks)
4. All Pull requests **must** follow git convention format in the title naming
   1. Setting fix: or feat: will help the automated release manager identify those pull requests to be included into the changelog

## Release

1. Create a PR from dev to release
2. A PR will be automated to create a new Tagging

# Sprints

## How to create a new sprint

* Its autocreated from the "iteration" data field,
  1. goto settings
  2. goto the iteration section
  3. Add iteration

## Adding a new item to Sprint

* Add a feature, link to the project

## Rolling over an item to the next sprint

* Its automated to rollover to the next sprint as long as the issue is in the columns (Todo, in progress, in review or Epic)

## Remove an item from sprint

* Go to the issue and untag the iteration
